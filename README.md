# CasinoWebApp

CasinoWebApp is a web application built with Node.js and Express, designed to simulate a casino slot machine game. This project provides a practical example of a full-stack application using modern web technologies and cloud services, specifically AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Getting Started

This project is an excellent way to showcase a Node.js and Express application integrated with AWS. The casino slot machine theme is engaging and allows for a variety of features and functionalities to be implemented, such as user authentication, session management, and dynamic content updates.

Building a casino website provides:
- **Engaging User Experience**: A game-based application is interactive and demonstrates dynamic content updates and state management.
- **Complex Features**: Handling user authentication, session management, and real-time updates can be a challenge, showcasing the robustness of Node.js and Express.
- **Real-World Use Case**: Simulates a real-world application where users interact with the system, make transactions, and receive feedback, making it a comprehensive example of web application development.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later): For running the application server.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager for managing dependencies.
- **AWS CLI**: To interact with AWS services from the command line.
- **Elastic Beanstalk CLI**: For deploying applications to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Authentication

The application uses session-based authentication to manage user sessions. Users can:
- **Register**: Create a new account with a username and password.
- **Login**: Access the site by entering valid credentials.
- **Logout**: End the session and redirect to the login page.

Authentication is managed using `express-session` and `bcrypt` for password hashing.

### Node.js and Express

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware management.

Key features include:
- **Routing**: Handles different routes for home, slot machine, profile, and authentication pages.
- **Middleware**: Manages form data parsing, session handling, and static file serving.

### AWS

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: A service for deploying and scaling web applications. It handles infrastructure management and scaling, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

### How to Deploy

1. **Set Up AWS CLI and Elastic Beanstalk CLI**:
   - Configure AWS CLI with your credentials:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - Initialize Elastic Beanstalk:
     ```bash
     eb init
     ```
   - Create an environment and deploy:
     ```bash
     eb create <environment-name>
     eb deploy
     ```

2. **Update Your Application**:
   - Make changes to `app.js` or other files.
   - Deploy updates:
     ```bash
     eb deploy
     ```

3. **Monitor and Manage**:
   - Use the Elastic Beanstalk console to monitor application health and view logs.
   - Adjust environment settings as needed.

For detailed deployment steps, refer to the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html).
